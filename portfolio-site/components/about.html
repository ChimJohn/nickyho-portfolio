      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        From aerospace electronics to software engineering — it’s been a journey of chasing curiosity
        and building things that work beautifully. I focus on creating digital experiences that blend 
        design thinking with engineering precision — systems that don’t just function, but feel great to use.
      </p>

        Sports have been a big part of my story — from earning a black belt in taekwondo to years in football 
        and track. They’ve taught me discipline, focus, and drive — the same qualities I now bring into code, 
        problem-solving, and innovation. Always learning. Always pushing forward.
