      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My journey began in aerospace electronics, where I discovered the beauty of systems that 
        are both precise and purposeful. That same curiosity led me to software engineering, where 
        logic meets creativity and every line of code can make life a little easier. I enjoy 
        building digital experiences that are functional, intuitive, and enjoyable to use.

        Sports have shaped how I approach challenges. Earning a black belt in taekwondo, playing 
        football, and running track taught me discipline, focus, and perseverance. These lessons 
        guide how I work, staying calm under pressure, adapting to change, and continuously striving 
        to learn, build, and grow.
